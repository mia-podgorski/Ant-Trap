# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title will most likley be Ant Trap

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Ant Trap is a game similar to snake where the user will control the ant and eat food to add more ants the the line. There will also be spider webs where the ant get get trapped and either end the game or be penalized.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Ant Trap will be created with Pygame and or arcade. I will create a game loop and a a feature to keep score. Imagies will be used to create a background and for the characters. The user will be able to control the ant moving it up, down, left, or right. The game will end when the ant hits the boundries, the traps or itself. A message will display when the game is over. There will be food for the ant to collect and the number of ants will increaase it collides with the food. This is similar to a snake game; the difference will be the traps. I would like to be able to have multiple levels. I would like to create a mini game inside of this where if the ant is trap in the web than the user has to solve a maze to get out.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

none

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

none

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what I will create a game loop and have functioning window. I will have a working and playable snake like game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can put the simpliest form of this game together with only one level. It will have all of the acrcade like features. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to take this project further by creating more levels increasing in difficulty including the mini maze game inside of this. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to research pygame and arcade more. I have a basic understanding of how games are made. So far I have the game loop and window. Next I need to create the sprites for the ants and work on moving the ants. There need to be a function for keeping score. I need to figure out how to add more ants or sprites when it collides with the food. I also need to focus on how to end the game when there is a unwanted collision. I am going to need to do a lot more research to be able to create levels and mini games inside of the main game. I have start with two good resources to help me figure out the basics.
